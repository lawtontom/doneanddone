## Done and Done

###Yet another todo app...  

Designed to create a Todo app API to be consumed in multiple ways

###Rational

This repo is setup to be an experimental area to test out ideas, whilst perhaps creating something vaguely useful.  It will hopefully fulfil the following:

- Experiment with Behat and BDD, and their relation to API development
- Oauth2 implementations
- Experiment with Laravel 5.1
- Hopefully another whole load of other stuff...
